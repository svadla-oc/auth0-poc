Wekan is an open-source and collaborative kanban board application.

Whether you’re maintaining a personal todo list, planning your holidays with
some friends, or working in a team on your next revolutionary idea, Kanban
boards are an unbeatable tool to keep your things organized. They give you a
visual overview of the current state of your project, and make you productive by
allowing you to focus on the few items that matter the most.

Wekan supports most features you would expect of it including a real-time user
interface, import from Trello (on standalone Wekan), cards comments, checklists,
member assignations, customizable labels, closing lists, filtered views, and more.

SSO options like LDAP, passwordless email, SAML, GitHub and Google Auth are
already available on Sandstorm, not standalone Wekan. Sandstorm is Enterprise
scale highly secure platform with grains, logging, admin settings,
server clustering, App Market and it's now fully Open Source. Sandstorm is
preferred platform for Wekan, as it would take a lot of work to reimplement
everything in standalone Wekan.

You don’t have to trust us with your data and can install Wekan on your own
computer or server. In fact we encourage you to do that by providing
one-click installation on various platforms.

## Roadmap

Upcoming Wekan App Development Platform will make possible
many use cases like kanban workflows, dependencies, gantt charts,
WIP limits, time tracking, managing website, Rocket.Chat support
and custom apps with themes by providing Teams/Organizations,
APIs, admin interface, custom fields, calendar view, time tracking,
vote on cards, move cards to another board and board templates.
Some of these don't even have feature requests in Wekan issues,
so we do need detailed descriptions, screenshots and links to
videos how these should work.

We are very welcoming to new developers and teams to submit new pull
requests to devel branch to make this Wekan App Development Platform possible
faster. Please see [Developer Documentation][dev_docs] to get started.
We also welcome sponsors for features. By working directly with Wekan you
get the benefit of active maintenance and new features added by
growing Wekan developer community.

[Roadmap is self-hosted on Wekan][roadmap_wefork]

At roadmap there is links to [Wekan GitHub issues][wekan_issues] where actual
work happens. If you don't see your feature request at GitHub issues,
please add it. Not all feature requests have been added to roadmap board yet.

Content is being copied from [old Wekan roadmap][roadmap_wekan] to
new one in process of merging Wefork back to Wekan.

Since Wekan is a free software, you don’t have to trust us with your data and can
install Wekan on your own computer or server. In fact we encourage you to do
that by providing one-click installation on various platforms.

## Supported Platforms

Automatic generated newest builds are available for Docker, and some others that
install directly from this repo. Automatic builds will be added later for more
platforms.

### Docker: [Docker image][docker_image], [Docs at wiki][wekan_wiki]

Docker example, running latest Wekan using docker-compose:

#### Running from remote dockerhub images
```
sudo docker-compose pull && sudo docker-compose up -d --no-build
```

#### PostgreSQL read-only mirroring using dockerhub images

[Wekan <=> MongoDB <=> ToroDB => PostgreSQL read-only mirroring for SQL access
with any programming language or Office package that has PostgreSQL support, like
newest LibreOffice 3.5][wekan_postgresql].

#### Running from locally built dockerhub images
```
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Running from locally built dockerhub images and modified `ARG` variables (not recommended)
```
echo 'NODE_VERSION=v6.6.0' >> .env && \
echo 'METEOR_RELEASE=1.4.2.3' >> .env && \
echo 'NPM_VERSION=4.1.2' >> .env && \
echo 'ARCHITECTURE=linux-x64' >> .env && \
echo 'SRC_PATH=./' >> .env && \
sudo docker-compose up -d --build
```

Docker example, running latest Wekan using docker run commands alone:
```
docker run -d --restart=always --name wekan-db mongo:3.2.11

docker run -d --restart=always --name wekan --link "wekan-db:db" -e "MONGO_URL=mongodb://db" -e "ROOT_URL=http://localhost:8080" -p 8080:80 mquandalle/wekan:latest
```
